# Operators

2+3
An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value. Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates the operands. In JavaScript operators are used for compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc. There are various operators supported by JavaScript:

Operator in JS :-

operator are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
ex. A + B
in this above example A,B are the operands & "+" is the operator.

there are 5 types of operator are their in javascript

arithmetic operator
(+,-,\*,/) modulus -> % exponentiation -> \*\*

unary operator increment (++) decreament (--)

assignment operator (assign some values to the variables) (=, +=, -=, \*=, %=, \*\*=)

comparison operator (compair the values) it gives the result of true or false. equal to -> == not equal to -> != equal to & type -> === not equal to & type -> !== , >,< , <=, >=

logical operator checks the logic of the operator(true/false)
logical AND (&&) -> table of logical AND operator is -> cond1 cond2 res(&&) T T T
T F F
F T F
F F F

logical OR (||) -> table of logical OR operator is -> cond1 cond2 res(&&)
T T T
T F T
F T T
F F F

logical Not (!)

- Arithmetic Operators
