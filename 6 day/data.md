Intro on Javascript:-
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation.

JavaScript is a programming language that is mainly used to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces for websites and web applications.

javascript is high level programming language for building web application more efficient way.

javascript is mainly used for building logics or functionality of a web pages.

javascript works on both client side as well as server side rendering.

javascript is comes from ecma script so we see the latest version of javascript in the form of ecma script.
Now we used javascrpt version 6 i.e ES6 (echma script 6).
In another way we called ES6 as the vanilla javascript.

Variable:-

variable is a container to store some data.
var a=10
there are 3 types of varible present over the javascript.
let:-
let a=10;
Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
Now these days, most of the cases we use let for creating variable.
Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most cases.

var:-
var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
var is used in oldest browser so now a days we don't use var, most of the cases.

const:-

const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc..

var a=10
let A=10
let a_b=10

Rules for creating variable name :-

variable names are case sensative "a", & "A" is different.
Only underscore & $ is allowed. (not even space)
Only underscore or $ should be the 1st character only.
reserved words cannot be variables names.

Homework :-

difference between let & var.
difference between var & const.

Datatypes in JS :-

data types is an attributes associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpet its value.
in data types we used "typeof" operator to know that what type of data it is.
mainly in javascript their are 2 types of data types.
primitive :-
in javascript their are 7 types of primitive data types.
Number - Number are the type of data types those it contain some numerical values.

Boolean - in Boolean data types we get boolean value like true, false.

Undefined - in undefined data types the data is not define so that it will show undfined.

Null - in this data type we get null for the value means nothing.

bigInt - in bigInt we will get big integer value

Symbol - in symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type

String - String is a type of data type that can hold some character like names...

Reference or Non-primitive :-

non primitive data type are the type of data type that can hold multiple items in a single time
non primitive data types are - object, array, function etc..
objects is a non primitive data types which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
mainly objects are working on (key:value) pair.
the left side part is our keys of object & right side parts are the objects of the project. ex. object -
let student = { name : " name", mob-no : "121212", college : "lg" }
